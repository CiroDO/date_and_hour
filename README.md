# date_and_hour
A simple Rust program that displays date and hour, and passes time.

This is an amateur little program. I'm new in Rust Lang, and I hope to master it as soon as my experience coding another projects increase in the months/years to come.
I hope i've written everything well, due to the fact that english isn't my mother language (I'm brazilian), and I also hope that you enjoy this program and give me some advice about how to improve it. Hugs c:
