# date_and_hour
A simple Rust program that displays date and hour, and passes time.

Most of the variables are written in portuguese (my mother language), just as the strings inside it. In future editings I'm going to rename everything as possible to make this code readable by a wider range of programmers.
This is an amateur little program. I hope to master Rust Lang as soon as my experience coding another projects increase in the months/years to come.

A quick reference to some words in portuguese that you might see in the terminal:
"dia", "mÃªs", "ano" = day, month, year
"horas", "minutos", "segundos" = hours, minutes, seconds

In Brazil, date is formatted as DD/MM/YYYY.
